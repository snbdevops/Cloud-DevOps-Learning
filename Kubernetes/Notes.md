# 1 Kubernetes for Beginers by Mumshad Sir

Kubernetes = Containers + Orchesteration

### I) Contaiers: Completely Isolated Environement. As in they can have their own processes or services, their own networking interfaces, their own mounts, just like virtual machines, except they're all shared the same operating system kernel.

If you look at operating systems like ubuntu, fedora, Suse, or CentOS, they all consist of two things an OS kernel and a set of software. The operating system kernel is responsible for interacting with the underlying hardware, while the OS kernel remains the same, which is Linux. In this case, it's the software above it that makes these operating systems different. 

The software may consist of a different user interface drivers, compilers, file managers, developer tools, etc. so you have a common Linux kernel shared across all operating systems, and some custom software that differentiates operating systems from each other.

The main purpose of Docker is to containerize applications and to ship them and run them.
