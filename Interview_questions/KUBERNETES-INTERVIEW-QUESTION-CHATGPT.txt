1. **What is Kubernetes, and what problems does it solve?**
   - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It solves challenges related to container orchestration, scalability, reliability, and resource utilization in distributed systems.

2. **Explain the architecture of Kubernetes.**
   - Kubernetes architecture consists of a control plane (master components) responsible for managing the cluster and worker nodes (minion components) where containers are deployed and executed. Master components include API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd, while minion components include kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime.

3. **What are Pods in Kubernetes, and why are they used?**
   - Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share the same network and storage namespace. They are used to encapsulate an application's containers and provide a cohesive unit of deployment, scaling, and management.

4. **Explain the role of the kubelet in Kubernetes.**
   - The kubelet is an agent running on each worker node in Kubernetes, responsible for managing containers' lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and monitoring containers based on Pod specifications.

5. **How does Kubernetes achieve high availability?**
   - Kubernetes achieves high availability through various mechanisms, including replication of master components, automatic failover and recovery, distributed storage with etcd, and deployment of application replicas across multiple nodes.

### Kubernetes Networking:

6. **Explain Kubernetes networking models (e.g., pod-to-pod communication, service discovery).**
   - Kubernetes networking models facilitate communication between Pods within the same node (via localhost), between Pods in different nodes (using overlay networks), and service discovery through Kubernetes Services (internal and external).

7. **What are Kubernetes Services, and how do they enable service discovery?**
   - Kubernetes Services are an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. They enable service discovery by providing a stable IP address and DNS name to access a set of Pods, regardless of their actual locations.

8. **What is an Ingress Controller in Kubernetes, and how does it work?**
   - An Ingress Controller is a Kubernetes resource responsible for managing external access to services within a cluster. It typically routes incoming traffic based on rules defined in Ingress resources to appropriate backend services.

9. **Explain the difference between Kubernetes Ingress and LoadBalancer Services.**
   - Ingress resources provide HTTP and HTTPS routing capabilities for external traffic, while LoadBalancer Services expose services externally using cloud provider load balancers, distributing traffic across multiple backend Pods.

10. **How do you secure Kubernetes networking?**
    - Kubernetes networking can be secured using network policies to define rules for traffic flow between Pods, implementing encryption for intra-cluster communication, enabling RBAC for API access control, and using authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Kubernetes Storage:

11. **What are Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)?**
    - PersistentVolumes (PVs) are storage resources in Kubernetes, while PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) are requests made by Pods for storage. PVCs consume PVs and provide a way for Pods to access persistent storage.

12. **Explain the difference between static and dynamic provisioning of storage in Kubernetes.**
    - Static provisioning involves pre-provisioning storage resources before Pods request them, while dynamic provisioning automatically provisions storage based on PVC requests, utilizing storage classes and volume plugins.

13. **How do you configure storage in Kubernetes for stateful applications?**
    - Storage for stateful applications can be configured using PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) with appropriate access modes, storage classes, and volume plugins (e.g., NFS, AWS EBS, CSI drivers).

14. **What are StatefulSets in Kubernetes, and when are they used?**
    - StatefulSets are Kubernetes resources used to manage stateful applications with unique identities and stable network identities. They ensure ordered deployment and scaling, persistent storage, and proper pod management during updates and failures.

15. **Explain Kubernetes Volume types and their use cases (e.g., emptyDir, hostPath, persistentVolumeClaim).**
    - Volume types include emptyDir (temporary storage), hostPath (host machine's file system), persistentVolumeClaim (dynamically provisioned storage), and others like NFS, iSCSI, AWS EBS, GCE Persistent Disk, etc., each suited for different use cases.

### Kubernetes Security:
