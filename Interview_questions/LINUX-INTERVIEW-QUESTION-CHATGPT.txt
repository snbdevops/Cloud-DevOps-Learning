Creating a list of 100 interview questions and answers for Linux at an advanced level can be quite extensive, but I'll provide you with a comprehensive list covering various aspects of Linux administration, troubleshooting, scripting, and more. Here are the questions and answers:

### Linux Basics:

1. **What is Linux?**
   - Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

2. **Explain the difference between UNIX and Linux.**
