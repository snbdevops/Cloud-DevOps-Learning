3. **What is the difference between Ansible and other configuration management tools like Puppet or Chef?**
   - Ansible is agentless, relies on SSH for communication, uses YAML for configuration, and is simpler to set up compared to Puppet or Chef.

4. **How does Ansible work?**
   - Ansible connects to nodes via SSH and executes tasks defined in YAML files called playbooks, using modules to perform actions on the nodes.

5. **What is an Ansible playbook?**
   - An Ansible playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts, along with associated configurations and conditions.

### Ansible Architecture:

6. **Explain the components of Ansible architecture.**
   - Ansible architecture consists of control nodes (where Ansible is installed), managed nodes (hosts to be managed), inventories (lists of managed nodes), playbooks (sets of tasks), and modules (units of work executed by Ansible).

7. **What is an Ansible Control Node?**
   - An Ansible control node is a system where Ansible is installed and from which Ansible commands and playbooks are executed.

8. **What are Managed Nodes in Ansible?**
   - Managed nodes are the remote hosts that Ansible manages and configures. These are the systems where tasks are executed.

9. **Explain Ansible inventories.**
