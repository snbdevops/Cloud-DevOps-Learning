### Scenario#1: Transit Gateway with default route tables which are auto generated (Full Mesh Architecture).




### Scenario#2: Transit Gateway sharing across cross accounts to enable connectivity to cross account VPC's.


### Scenario#3: Transit Gateways with custom Route Tables (Control the connectivity between VPC's using TGW Route Tables).
